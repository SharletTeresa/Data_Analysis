# Hospital Appointment Cancellation Analysis

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the common reasons behind the frequent cancellations of appointments at hospitals. Our goal is to identify the key factors contributing to these cancellations and investigate the underlying causes.

## Key Findings

Through our analysis, we have identified that a significant factor leading to appointment cancellations is the delay in the appointment scheduling process. Patients often cancel their appointments if there is a considerable gap between the scheduling and the actual appointment date.

## Solutions

Addressing the delays in scheduling could potentially decrease the cancellation rates significantly. Implementing more efficient scheduling systems or processes could be crucial in resolving these issues and improving overall appointment adherence.

## Conclusion

Our investigation highlights the need for improved scheduling processes in hospitals to minimize appointment cancellations. Prompt and efficient scheduling could enhance patient commitment and reduce the operational inefficiencies currently faced by healthcare facilities.
